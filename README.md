# ❄️ AWS-S3-SNOWFLAKE-DATA-CLEANING ❄️

## Project Description ##
This project involves setting up an AWS S3 bucket and creating the necessary roles and integrations to link S3 with Snowflake. The data file, in CSV format, was sourced from this GitHub repo: https://github.com/iweld/data_cleaning. After establishing the integration and creating a Snowflake stage, the data was loaded into a pre-created table. Each column was tested, cleaned, and transformed as needed. The cleaned data was then copied into a new, refined table, ready for export to Power BI, which will be the next step in the project.

## Technologies ##
- 📦 AWS S3
- ❄️ Snowflake
- 📊 PowerBI (in the future)
